# Code Review

A very important part of being a developer is to keep up with latest technologies and always learn new stuff.
Throughout the time we gain experience, we learn a lot of things on online courses. There are a LOT of courses out there! 
But which of them are good? Which will help you comprehend thoroughly? Which will waste your precious time and money?

We built a review platform for courses, where anybody can add reviews for online courses they took. 
Do you want to check what others have to say about the course? Look it up!
The course you want to review isn't in the pool? just add it!
